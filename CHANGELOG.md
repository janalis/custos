# Changelog

All notable changes to custos. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `ProperNullCoalescingOperatorUsage`: a scalar fallback of another scalar
  type (`$id ?? 'new'`) and an array fallback for an iterable object
  (`$node->attributes ?? []`, a Doctrine `Collection`) are no longer
  reported.
- `NotOptimalIfConditions`: property reads that run code (a PHP 8.4 `get`
  hook, a virtual, abstract or interface property, `__get()`) cost like a
  method call and are never reordered; reads on an unknown receiver are
  left out of the comparison.
- `PropertyInitializationFlaws`: a property default equal to the default of
  the constructor parameter assigned to it is kept (objects built without
  the constructor, such as old serialized messages, still see it).
- `TraitsPropertiesConflicts`: a trait property that re-declares a parent
  property only to attach attributes is no longer reported; a hooked
  property composed with a same-named trait property is an error, while
  the parent's hooks are ignored when a trait re-declares its property.
- `VariableFunctionsUsage`: `call_user_func('name', …)` is kept when a
  same-named namespace function or a `use function` shadows the global
  function at the call (a wrapper reaching the builtin).
- `PhpUnitTests`: `empty()` checks become `assertEmpty()`/`assertNotEmpty()`
  only when the operand is known to be a scalar, an array or null (PHPUnit
  counts `Countable` objects), and `assertTrue(!empty($x))` names the
  assertion its fix writes.
- `UnnecessaryCasting`: a `(string)` cast in a concatenation is reported
  only when its operand is known to be a string, int or float, not on
  nullable, `bool`, `mixed` or `__toString()` operands.
- Parser: in permissive mode, a property or promoted-parameter default
  followed by hooks is no longer read as a legacy `$a{0}` offset.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-08

First public release.

### Added

- 178 PHP inspections in 12 groups (probable bugs, performance, security,
  control flow, code style, unused code, PHPUnit, language-level migration
  5.3 → 8.5, …), 108 of them with quick-fixes. Rules follow the target PHP
  version. Rule IDs are compatible with Php Inspections (EA Extended), so
  existing `@noinspection` comments keep working; `@custos-ignore` works
  too. See the [rule reference](https://janalis.github.io/custos/rules/).
- CLI: `analyse` (text, json, checkstyle, github and sarif output;
  `--fail-on`; baselines for legacy code), `fix` (`--dry-run`, `--diff`,
  parallel), `rules`, `explain`, `lsp`, `version`.
- Language server: diagnostics, quick-fixes, fix-all, "suppress for this
  statement" code action, and a background project index kept current
  through file watching. Setup guides for Neovim, Helix, VS Code, PhpStorm,
  Sublime Text and Emacs.
- Configuration through an optional `custos.json` (paths, rules and their
  options, baseline); the PHP target falls back to `composer.json`.
- Own PHP 5.3–8.5 parser (lossless, error tolerant) and semantic layer: a
  symbol index with embedded JetBrains phpstorm-stubs, type inference with
  narrowing, and PHPDoc support (generics and `@template`, type aliases,
  array shapes, conditional return types, `@param-out`, phpstan/psalm
  assertions).
- Distribution: release archives for Linux, macOS and Windows (amd64,
  arm64), a Homebrew cask (`brew install janalis/tap/custos`) and a Composer
  package (`composer require --dev janalis/custos`) whose launcher downloads
  the checksum-verified binary.
- Documentation site: <https://janalis.github.io/custos/> (user guide, one
  page per rule with examples and quick-fix results, contributor guide).

### Security

- Hostile input cannot crash, hang or exhaust the analyser: nesting depth,
  file size (10 MB), syntax errors and findings per file are capped, PHPDoc
  types are parsed in linear time, and known quadratic paths were removed.
- Only regular files are read, with size caps; `paths` and `baseline` must
  stay inside the project; `custos fix` never writes through symlinks; the
  language server rejects malformed or oversized messages.

### Notes

- custos is a clean-room implementation and intentionally differs from
  upstream where upstream behaviour is wrong (false positives, fixes that
  change semantics or produce invalid PHP).
